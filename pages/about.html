    <p class="project-title-description ">I began my career in the finance industry, which was a profound learning experience, from gaining experience with collaboration with colleagues and daily interaction with clients. I was inspired by software for the first time when I realized how much of the work we were doing that could have been automated and how much human capital and man hours were spent in unnecissarily repetitive tasks. I've always been fascinated with technology and fully believe in its potential for improving our lives, so as soon as I got a chance I enrolled in the best software development bootcamp I could find, which was offered by App Academy. Throughout 2018 when I was working full time, I had still been working with a proffesor at the University of Cape Town to produce an economics masters paper and I even haulted this to persue software development since I believe it is where I could best use my personal analystical skills and unique education for the industry.  </p>
